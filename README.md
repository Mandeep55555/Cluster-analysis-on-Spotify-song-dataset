# Cluster-analysis-on-Spotify-song-dataset

The goal of this project is to use cluster analysis to identify patterns and similarities among Spotify songs based on their audio features. The dataset includes over 232,000 songs with 18 audio features like danceability, energy, loudness, and tempo.

Implemented steps:

1. Data Acquisition and Exploration
• Imported libraries and loaded the dataset
• Examined the structure and features of the dataset
• Checked for missing or duplicate values, data types and convert 
• To get a sense of the data, used some basic descriptive statistics.

2. Data Preparation
• Removed irrelevant features
• Normalise or standardise the data as needed
• Encoded categorical variables and Split the dataset into training and testing 
subsets.

4. Data Visualization
• Visualized the data in different ways to gain insights
• Created histograms, scatterplots, correlation matrices, etc. to identify patterns and 
relationships among variables

5. Model Building and Evaluation
• Selected an appropriate clustering algorithm based on the problem requirements and data 
characteristics.
• Trained the predictive model using the training set subset and Predicted the cluster labels for 
the testing subset.

6. Model Interpretation
• Analysed the cluster results and identified the characteristics of each cluster
• Created visualisations to assist in the interpretation and communication of the results
